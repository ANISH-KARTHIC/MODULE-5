# ðŸ§© Module 5: Guessing Game Using Binary Search Technique

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Module Matters  
- Introduces students to efficient problem-solving through algorithms  
- Teaches the concept of narrowing down possibilities using logic  
- Shows how computers (or players) can "guess smart" rather than randomly  
- Encourages thinking in terms of strategy, not just syntax

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New in This Module  
- Implements a basic version of the binary search algorithm within the guessing game  
- The program (or the player) adjusts the guess range based on feedback (e.g., "too high", "too low")  
- Moves from reactive guessing to calculated, optimal guessing

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Introduced  
- **Binary Search**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that halves the search range each time  
- **Min/Max Bounds**: Keeping track of the current lower and upper bounds for guessing  
- **Midpoint Calculation**: Using `(low + high) // 2` to find the next guess  
- **Efficiency**: Understanding why binary search is faster than random or linear guessing
